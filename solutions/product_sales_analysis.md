##  identify the top-selling products based on total sales

```sql
SELECT p.productName, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS totalRevenue
FROM Products p
JOIN Orders o ON p.productID = o.productID
GROUP BY p.productName
ORDER BY totalRevenue DESC;
```

**explaination**:
The above query retrieves the top-selling products and their respective sales revenue by joining the Products and Orders tables. It calculates the total revenue for each product by multiplying the quantity of each order by the price of the product. The results are grouped by product name and ordered by total revenue in descending order, showing the top-selling products first.
